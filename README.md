###WebBlock jQuery Plugin

WebBlock jQuery Plugin was made for one of my project to display an alert just like other websites that shows an information from an event that has been triggered by the end user. The goal of the plugin is to help every web pages to show the important message or an alert that has been specifically displayed by an element. Let say you have a method that will return an error, then I think you have to use this plugin and will serve you without any hassle by displaying what you want. Basically this is the same as the blockui plugin but this one is more easier.

###Version
1.0

###Installation and Usage

####The jQuery Library and the web blocker library
Before you begin, you need to install the jQuery library into your HTML code. New versions will do.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>
```

Next, place the web blocker plugin right after the jQuery library:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/js/WebBlock.js"></script>
```

####Create your own button

In this demonstration, I create a button that once I clicked this, it will show what you expect:

```html
 <input type="button" name="blocker" value="Start Blocking" id="blocker" />
```
