###WebBlock jQuery Plugin

WebBlock jQuery Plugin was made for one of my project to display an alert just like other websites that shows an information from an event that has been triggered by the end user. The goal of the plugin is to help every web pages to show the important message or an alert that has been specifically displayed by an element. Let say you have a method that will return an error, then I think you have to use this plugin and will serve you without any hassle by displaying what you want.
